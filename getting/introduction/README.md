# INTRODUCTION

JavaScript (js) is a light-weight **object-oriented** programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an **interpreted**, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.

### HISTORY

In 1993, **Mosaic**, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the **year 1994**, **Netscape** was founded by **Marc Andreessen**. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited **Brendan Eich** intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with **Sun Microsystems** for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named '**Mocha**'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with '**LiveScript**'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.

### Application of JavaScript

 JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

- **Client-side validation :** This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.

- **Manipulating HTML Page :** Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

- **User Notifications :** You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.

- **Back-end Data Loading :** Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.

- **Server Applications :**  Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.

# ECAMSCRIPT or JAVASCRIPT

- **javascript** : programming langage

- **ECMASCRIPT** : standardization body

- **ECMA-262** ( **ECMASCRIPT**): it's a version of javascript
